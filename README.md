# How to play

Go to 

The game is played by two players taking turns to move their pieces on the chessboard. The game follows standard chess rules, including en passant and castling.

To move a piece, click on the piece you want to move and then click on the destination square. If a move is not valid, the game will prompt you to enter a valid move.
