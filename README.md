Chesser is a chess game built with Next.js and javascript. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same computer. No chess library were used.

# How to play

Go to https://chesser-kappa.vercel.app/

The game is played by two players taking turns to move their pieces on the chessboard. The game follows standard chess rules, including en passant, castling and stalemate.

To move a piece, click on the piece you want to move and then click on the destination square. If a move is not valid, it won't be possible to move.
